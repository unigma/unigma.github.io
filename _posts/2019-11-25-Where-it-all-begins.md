Ughhhh, sooooo boooring!

Imma do some _fun and mysterious_ games here with y'all.

But not sure if anyone is interested. Like some coded messages and stuff or on-campus secret images.

Expect my message.

Be careful though â€“ check if the same message is present at [https://unigma.github.io](https://unigma.github.io).

Feeling sleepy now, will post something soon though.

For now, bye!

PS: I know, if you look this website up you can easily figure out who I am.
But most people don't bother doing that. So please, don't spoil anything :P

PPS: Not that I'm trying to hide myself, but just for fun y'know!
